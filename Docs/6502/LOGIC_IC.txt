Random logic interconnections.

Inputs
------

PHI1,PHI2: timing
Reset0: from RST pin
NMIG: from NMI logic
/IR5: from instruction register, to determine CLC/SEC and others
SO: from SO pin, set V-flag
RDY: from RDY pin

BRKDONE, VEC: from interrupt priority logic

2 inputs from predecode logic.

129 lines from PLA.

AVR: overflow out from ALU
ACR: carry out from ALU

Outputs
-------

TRES: reset T-counter
sync: shift T-counter, additionally output to SYNC pin
T0, T1X: first two steps of instruction decoding, to PLA
R/W: Goes to R/W pin and data latch
fetch: Force instruction register to load from Predecode Register
VEC0: to interrupt priority logic, when BRK detected

48 output drivers, to control bottom part.

Also random logic is connected to internal data bus (DB) to exchange status reg (flags).
